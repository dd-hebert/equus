# Carbon backbone generation methods

This is a submodule designed to generate backbones via permutation of input structures, heavily relying on SMARTS.

## List of individual permutation methods
Reduction.  
Oxidation.  
Breaking single bonds.  
Replacing atoms.  
Replacing SELFIES tokens.  
Adding small groups. (This is not necessarily only for backbone generation.)

Note:
To convert backbones to diamines/diimines, please use equus.edit.generate.
